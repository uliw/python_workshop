As a new twist, I will also use a library that can test whether a file is present or not. This is because I spent 20 minutes debugging my code without realizing that I had the wrong filename. So I decided to include this here. It may prove useful. The code is straightforward and simply raises an error if the file is not present. To test whether the file is present, we import the pathlib-library, which imports tools to deal with file and path names (e.g., checking whether a file is present). I recommend using this code snippet in your submissions.

A Pandas series, on the other hand, can only have one data type per column. In other words, a column can contain strings, integers, floats etc., but all entries in a given column must be of the same type. Since column `A` consists only of numbers, python can directly multiply each element with 2. What happens if you multiply `A*B`? Is the multiplication element by element, or do you get the cross product?  What happens if you write `A**B`?  Hurray! no more loops!  (kinda&#x2026;)\n\nIn a way, python treats a pandas series object like a vector, not unlike Matlab. There is some cool stuff we can do with this.
