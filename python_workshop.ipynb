If you happen to have your own Python installation, you can also download this notebook (and all the data) to run it locally on your computer.\n\nJupyter Notebooks have three types of areas: \n\n1.  A text area like this. Text areas can be edited.\n2.  A code area like the one below this list paragraph. Code areas can be edited and the code can be executed.\n3.  A result area, which contains the output (if there is any) from a code area.\n\nThese areas are also called 'cells'.

Rather than writing our Python code to read and import data from a spreadsheet, we use a so-called \"library\" that will do the job for us.

But a few explanations are in order.\n\n-   The function `plt.subplots()` creates a plot object. More precisely, it creates at least one `figure` and one `axes` object. But this function can also generate a figure with multiple subplots, hence the name (see below).\n-   The returned  `figure` and `axes` objects should really be named `canvas` and `figure`. Alas, everyone else calls them `fig` and `ax`. The `fig` object deals with the entire figure (canvas) which can hold more than one plot panel (`ax`). The `ax` object is specific to a given plot panel.\n-   Rereading the code above, you can now see that we use the `ax` object to plot the actual data. In the above case, use the `scatter` function, since we are dealing with discrete data.\n-   next, we use the `ax` object to set the axis labels, and then we save the figure. The figure format is determined by the filename extension.\n-   Lastly, we display the figure. This is always the last step since rendering the figure can be computationally expensive. Note, that this step also deletes the figure.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Why bother?\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We could have made the above figure with much less effort using Excel. So why bother typing all those commands? \n\n-   Unlike Excel, you have full control over every aspect of the figure.\n-   Once your figure becomes more complicated, working with Excel becomes difficult (think interrupted scales, multiple y-axes, etc.)\n-   Much of the typing above is boilerplate, and we can use a figure template like this one, and cut/copy/paste becomes your friend.
