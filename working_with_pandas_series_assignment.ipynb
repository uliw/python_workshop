Cut/copy/paste is your friend here. Note, your function should be able to deal with arbitrary length series.\n\n1.  Use the pathlib library to import the data from `example_file.csv` as a data frame, and create a pandas-series object for each column. Set all values in `A` that are smaller than 4, to zero.  Note, do not use a loop (hint: use boolean expressions). Display the data frame to verify that your operation succeeded.\n\n2.  Import the data from `example_file.csv` and write a short function and code snippet which calculates the mean of a Pandas series containing numbers. Do not use the built-in functions or the pandas method for mean. Rather use your own code to compute the mean &mu; as\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\mu = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{i=N} X_i}{N}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    the capital sigma sign on the right side is the math symbol for a sum, the subscript `i` refers to the index of a given vector element, $X_i$ denotes an individual element (i.e. `X[i]`) and N is equal to the number of elements in the series. In the equation above I added the index expression to highlight the relation between the equation and a pandas series, however, often you will see the abbreviated form, which means the same thing, but is faster to write\n    \n     \\begin{equation}\n    \\mu = \\frac{\\sum X_i}{N}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    call your function and compare the result against the mean values as returned by the pandas mean method, e.g.:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["print(f\"The mean value of A using my_mean = {my_mean(A)}\")\nprint(f\"The mean value of A using A.mean() = {A.mean()}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Notes: Your function must not assume a fixed length for the series. Avoid loops where possible and leverage the ability to apply operations to all elements of a data series object.\n\n3.  As before, but now we will compute the population standard deviation sigma ($\\sigma$) which is defined as\n    \n    \\begin{equation}   \n     \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\mu)^2}{N-1}}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    where $\\mu$ is the mean value.  Again, your code should be self-contained, and compare your result against the builtin pandas series method `A.std()`.  Notes: Your function must not assume a fixed length for the data series. Avoid loops where possible and leverage the ability to apply operations to all elements of a data series object.\n\n4.  Use the pathlib library to import the isotope data from `Yao_2018_pd_series.xlsx`. (`inside_peak`).  Extract the delta values as pandas series. Next, use the following two equations to first split the delta values (`d34S` in the spreadsheet) into $^{32}S$ and $^{34}S$ and append the results to the data frame as two new columns (`S32` and `S34`).\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    ^{32}S = \\frac{1000}{(\\delta^{34}S +1000) \\times R + 1000}\n    \\end{equation}\n    \n    \\begin{equation}\n    ^{34}S = \\frac{(\\delta^{34}S + 1000) \\times R}{(\\delta^{34}S + 1000) \\times R + 1000}    \t\n    \\end{equation}\n\nNext, compute the delta values from $^{32}S$  and $^{34}S$, as:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\delta^{34}S = \\left(\n\t \\frac{\n    \\left(\\frac{^{34}S}{^{32}S}\\right) _{Sample}}\n\t {R}\n\t  -1\n\t \\right) \\times 1000 \\quad [^0/_{00}]\n\\end{equation}\n\nand append the results to the data frame as a new column called `delta_new`. Compute the difference between the original and the new delta (it should be very small or zero). Export the data frame to a csv file.  Again, do not use loops and import whatever you need, declare all variables, add docstrings to your function definitions, use comments, and type hinting. Use an R-value of `R=0.044162589`. Remember to break down any coding task into a set of smaller steps that you can develop and test individually.\n\nA note on the &permil; sign. You already know the % sign, which means per cent = per hundred. So 50% = 50/100 = 0.5 The &permil; sign means per mil = per thousand. E.g., 20&permil; = 20/1000 = 0.002. While this is the traditional way to express the delta values, a more modern way is to use the pseudo unit \"Urey\" (after Harold Urey, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Urey), who pioneered stable isotope analysis).  Using this approach, 1&permil; = 1 mUr \n\nUse the following template to organize your code.
