So all of the functions provided by pandas are available\nas `pd.function_name()`. We will explore how to use some of the Pandas\nprovided functions below. Since pandas is a system library, you\ndo not need a local copy in each working directory.\n\nTo read the excel file  we need to know its name, and we need to\nknow the name of the data sheet we want to read. If the read operation\nsucceeds, the read data will be stored as a pandas data frame\nobject. You can think of the Pandas data frame as a table with rows,\ncolumns, headers, etc. Pay attention to the way I use type hinting\nto indicate that `os_peak` is a variable that contains a data frame.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd # inport pandas as pd\n\n# define the file and sheet name we want to read.
