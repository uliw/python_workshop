To keep things organized, we will use color instead of a legend, and we will use different line styles were necessary.

It is thus important to create figures with colors that can be differentiated regardless of the color deficiency. The default matplotlib color map (\"C0\", \"C1\", \"C2\" etc) is already tuned to address this problem.

Then try to plot it using the techniques you have learned so far.\n-   You can also use Chatgpt to help you plot your data. It is quite good at this. Try the following prompts (and copy the results into a code cell in \n    -   \"Write some Python code that imports an Excel file as pandas data frame\"\n    -   \"Add some Python code that plots the first and third column as scatter plot\"\n    -   \"Add some python code that plots the first and 2<sup>nd</sup> column as a dotted line\"\n    -   \"Can you explain what the following Python code does?\"\n-   If you have an interest in maps, open the `cartopy_example.ipynb` notebook.\n-   Linear Regression is one of the most abused statistical methods in earth science. While you can do this with three lines of Python code, you really should take a stats-course. If this is of interest to you, open the `Linear_Regression.ipynb` notebook and work through it. Maybe this could be a follow up workshop.\n-   If you want to learn Python programming, take ESS245 and arrange to get grad course credit (selected topics) credit for it.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### How to get help\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["-   During the workshop: Talk to your neighbor!\n-   After the workshop: If enough people remain subscribed to the Zulip channel, this might turn into a Python club where you can ask questions. Asking a good question is however a bit of an art. So follow all these steps in sequence **before** you post:\n    \n    -   Be specific about what you are asking. Dumping your code, and expecting other people to find the mistake is inconsiderate. So the first step is to isolate the problem. Can you write a short self-contained example that creates the error? By this time, you probably already solved the issue. If not, proceed to the next step.\n    -   Use the built-in help system. All Python objects have a help text (e.g., `help(print)`). The information might be too terse for a beginner, but it is worth a try.\n    -   Ask Chatgpt to explain your error (but test the answer, it is often wrong).\n    -   Google the error message\n    -   If the error message does not help, google how to do what you want to do (e.g., \"how to print a third y-axis with Matplotlib\"), or ask ChatGPT.\n    -   If none of that helps, ask on Zulip. For that, you need to include a short and self-contained code example that demonstrates the problem. Enclose your code between three backticks like this\n    \n        ```python\n        # add your code after this line\n        \n        ```\n\nSo that  Zulip (and other markdown-based software like GitHub, Stackoverflow etc.) know how to render your code.\n\nLast but not least, coding can be quite bewildering, so don't allow yourself to become discouraged. \n If need be, take a creative break and work on something else for a while.
